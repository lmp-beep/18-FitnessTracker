## Description
This Fitness Tracker App uses Express, Mongoose and MongoDB Atlas to create and track daily workouts. The user can enter weight, sets, reps and duration for resistance exercises, and enter distance and duration for cardio exercises. The user can then access the combined weight of multiple exercises, and the total duration of each workout, for the past seven days in convenient charts on the Dashboard page.
